pyWest Toolbar for Revit

Project Overview — What is your project all about? Who was it created for? Why is it important to you? When was it created? Where can we find it live or the official documentation? How does one go about using it live or within their own project?

Configuration instructions — Computer and Software configurations are recommended to achieve optimum performance based on operating systems such as Windows, iOS, Android, and mobile.

Installation instructions — This will include, but is not limited to, any packages and dependencies required to make your project function.

Operating instructions — “What is this? Where does this go?” Now is the time to demystify any assumptions around how to use your project.

A list of files included — Contingent upon how large your source code is, you may opt to not include the file tree, however you can still explain how to traverse through your code. For example, how is your code modularized? Did you use the MVC (Model, View, Controller) method? Did you use a Router system? Just a few questions to consider when detailing your file structure.

Copyright and licensing information — In order to let others know what they can and cannot do with your code, it is important to include a software license in your project. If you opt out of using a license then the default copyright laws will apply and you will retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. Hence the reason licenses are critical and highly recommended for open source projects.

Contact information for the distributor or programmer — Name, email, social media links, and any other helpful ways of getting in contact with you or members of your team.

Known bugs — This is the perfect place to put tickets of known issues that you are actively working on or have on backlog. Speaking of backlog, if your project is open source, this is will allow potential contributors an opportunity to review incomplete features.

Troubleshooting — In this section you will be able to highlight how your users can become troubleshooting masters for common issues encountered on your project.

Credits and acknowledgments — Who were the contributing authors on the project, whose code did you reference, which tutorials did you watch that help you bring this project to fruition? Sharing is caring and all praises are due for those that have helped no matter how small the contribution.

A changelog (usually for programmers) — A changelog is a chronological list of all notable changes made to a project such as: records of changes such as bug fixes, new features, improvements, new frameworks or libraries used, and etc.

A news section (usually for users) — If your project is live and in production and you are receiving feedback from users, this is a great place to let them know, “Hey, we hear you, we appreciate you, and because of your feedback here are the most recent changes, updates, and new features made.”
